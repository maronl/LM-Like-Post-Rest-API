===============

Wordpress plugin to enable basic social function throught rest-api: like e dislike. save post as favourite, follower and following. 

Just rest-api no front-end :). backoffice is improved showing like and saved counter in the post list. 

If you want to protect your api think about a JWT layer or modify access to rest-api only for logged users.
